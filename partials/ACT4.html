<dd>The next evolution of the Marvel Cinematic Universe brings a founding member of The Avengers to the big screen for the first time with Marvel Studios' "Ant-Man." Armed with the astonishing ability to shrink in scale but increase in strength, master thief Scott Lang must embrace his inner-hero and help his mentor, Dr. Hank Pym, protect the secret behind his spectacular Ant-Man suit from a new generation of towering threats. Against seemingly insurmountable obstacles, Pym and Lang must plan and pull off a heist that will save the world. -- (C) Marvel</dd>
<h3>CAST AND CREW</h3>
<dt><h4>Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt</h4></dt>
<dd>A former systems engineer at VistaCorp and petty criminal, who acquires a suit that allows him to shrink in size but increase in strength.[4][5][6][7][8] Regarding Rudd's casting, producer Kevin Feige said, "Look at that origin of the petty crook who comes into contact with a suit and does his best to make good, and then look at someone like Paul Rudd, who can do slightly unsavory things like break into people’s houses and still be charming and who you root for and whose redemption you will find satisfaction in."[5] On the character, Peyton Reed said, "He's not used to being a hero. He's more like George Clooney['s character Danny Ocean] in Ocean's Eleven. He’s a guy trying to create a new life for himself and find redemption." To get in shape for the role, Rudd worked with trainers and cut alcohol, fried foods and carbohydrates out of his diet.[9] Rudd stated that in preparation for his role, he "basically didn’t eat anything for about a year ... I took the Chris Pratt approach to training for an action movie. Eliminate anything fun for a year and then you can play a hero."[10] Rudd signed a multi-film contract with Marvel, with Feige saying it was "three[ films]-plus-plus to appear in other things."[2]

<dt><B>Jon Voight as Jim Phelps</B></dt>
<dd>
The daughter of Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne and a senior board member of Pym Technologies, who helps Darren Cross take over the company.[11][12][13][14][15] Describing her character, Lilly said, "I was raised by two superheroes. So, I'm a pretty screwed up human being. I am also fairly capable, strong, and kick-ass, which is wonderful to play, but the most fun to play was just how messed up she was from being raised by two superheroes. And the clear message sent by my name is that I'm not a big fan of my father and so I took my mother's name."[16] She added that van Dyne's "arc in the movie is trying to find a relationship" with Pym.[9] Originally cast by Wright, Lilly was reluctant to take the role after he left the project until she read the revised script and got a chance to meet with Reed.[13] Feige said that van Dyne was the more obvious choice to take up the mantle of Ant-Man, being "infinitely more capable of actually being a superhero" than Lang, and that the reason she does not is because of Pym's experience with losing her mother, rather than sexism, which Feige felt would not be a problem for Pym in modern times. Subsequently, Feige stated that the film would hint at van Dyne eventually taking up the identity of Wasp from her mother.[17] Lilly signed a multi-film contract with Marvel.[18]

<br/>
<dt><I>Henry Czerny as Eugene Kittridge</I></dt>
<dd>A former protégé of Pym, who takes over Pym's company, and militarizes a similar version of the Ant-Man technology to create the Yellowjacket suit.[12][14][19][20] Describing the suit, Stoll said, "Darren Cross... has a suit that is sort of the next generation of Ant-Man’s suit. It can do everything that Ant-Man can do, but more. It’s more badass, more militaristic, sleeker... sort of like if Apple had designed a battle suit."[21] As for his character, Stoll said, "He is not a villain in the vein of Thanos or Loki, who are villains that know it. [Cross] is a guy who is not that dissimilar from Michael Douglas' character, Hank Pym. A brilliant scientist, who is not ethically pure. I think a great thing about the whole movie is that everybody in this movie is in those shades of gray a little bit."[22] Unlike Rudd, who wore a practical costume as Ant-Man, Stoll wore a motion capture suit when performing as Yellowjacket. Reed explained that this decision was made early on when creating and filming with a real Yellowjacket costume was found to be impractical.[23]

<br/>
<dt><h4>Jean Reno as Franz Krieger</h4></dt>
<dd>
A police officer[15][24][25] who is engaged to Lang's former wife Maggie.[26] Cannavale stated that Rudd and McKay convinced him to join the film, saying, "They sort of pumped [my] part up a bit in [their rewrite] and they both called me and said, 'You've got to do this.' They called me before Marvel called. I really went on good faith because they're so secretive over there about the script. I just trusted them." He also added that the process felt like an indie film instead of a large-scale blockbuster, and that he was able to improvise frequently along with the other actors.[26] Patrick Wilson was originally cast in the role[27] before leaving the film because of scheduling conflicts brought on by the filming delay.[28]
