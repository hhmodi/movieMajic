				<p>
According to the Jain literature, Bharat and bali were two of the sons of Bhagwaan Rishabh Dev, the first TEERTHANKAR of this epoch. When Bhagwaan Rishabh Dev renounced his kingdom, he gave a portion of it to each one of his sons. Bharat and Bahubali also received their shares.
A few years later, Bharat decided to become the supreme ruler of the world (CHAKRAVARTI). He demanded that all other kings should accept his supremacy. All the kings, including his brothers except Bahubali conceded. However, Bahubali challenged Bharat. The armies of Bharat and Bahubali faced each other, ready to fight. The ministers of Bharat and Bahubali were worried about the bloodshed. Therefore, they counseled that the two brothers should engage in hand-to-hand combat to determine the winner. Bahubali and Bharat agreed.

The first round was a water-duel between Bharat and bali. They stood in the knee-deep water of a river and sprayed each other with water. bali won the round. The next round was a sight-duel. The two brothers stood in the sun, staring at each other. The one who blinked first was to lose the round. Again, Bharat lost. The final round was wrestling. A huge crowd had gathered. The supporters of each were cheering. In the course of the duel, Bahubali picked up Bharat. Carrying Bharat above his head, he whirled him in air as he paced the ring. bali's supporters were very happy and excited. bali was close to becoming the supreme ruler of the world. At that moment, he thought that he was about to hurt and humiliate his own brother for the sake of name and fame. He contemplated, "Such pride is false. What good is being a king or a supreme ruler of the world? Such desires are endless. Fulfillment of such desires cannot lead to peace of mind." He gently put Bharat down on his feet. He renounced his kingdom, and, started on the path to true happiness and peace of mind.

bali spent many years in meditation and penance. According to legend, he stood meditating for such a long time that anthills formed on the ground where he stood, snakes lay coiled at is feet, and creepers grew around them. But he did not attain omniscience (KEVAL JNAAN) because he had one straining conceit (SHALYA) in his mind. He was thinking that he was standing on the ground owned by his brother Bharat. For this reason, he could not shed the knowledge-obscuring, perception-obscuring, deluding and obstructing karmas that influence the soul. When Bharat came and consoled him, his mental strain vanished and he attained omniscience and NIRVANA.

Bhagwaan bali was a great soul and his story enlightens our lives. Chamundrai, the prime minister of King Rachmalla II of Ganga dynasty, built a colossal statue of Bhagwaan bali. It was consecrated under the guidance of the great Acharya Nemi Chandra Siddhant Chakravarti in 981 A.D. Chamundrai was also called Gommat and therefore the statue is called Gommateshwar. Chamundrai was a staunch follower of Acharya Nemi Chandra Siddhant Chakravarti. The two scriptural texts composed by Acharya Nemi Chandra Siddhant Chakravarti are entitled 'GOMMATASAAR JEEVAKAND' and 'GOMMATASAAR KARMAKAND'. www.gmail.com

The colossal statue of Gommateshwar stands 58 ft 8 in on the hill Vindhyagiri at Shravanabelgola near Mysore. It is the tallest known monolithic statue in the world carved out of a single huge granite boulder. In fact, the statue is part of the hill, sculpted by removing portions of the hilltop. The statue includes creepers, coiled snakes and anthills. The celebrated scholar, Kaka Kalelkar, describing the fact that it is nude, observed that the sculptors could easily extend the creepers to cover the nudity, but it would not have done justice to what Bhagwaan bali represented. Every twelve to fourteen years, the Great Head Bathing Ceremony (MAHA MASTAKAABHISHEK) of the statue is celebrated. The 1000th anniversary of the statue was observed between February 19 and 24, 1981, and the Great Head Bathing Ceremony was performed. In the March 16, 1981 issue of the TIME Magazine, the correspondent rightly observed, "The Great Head Bathing brings no absolution from sin. It propitiates no gods. ... Most important it does not help remove the oppressive cumulative weight of individual misdeeds known ... [as] KARMA. ... While the Hindus offered ritual, meditation and devotion to gods, the other two religions (Jainism and Buddhism) taught that KARMA and reincarnation could be escaped through the willed elimination of ego and desire."
