<p>A film, also called a movie or motion picture, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. The word "cinema" is often used to refer to the industry of films and filmmaking or to the art of filmmaking itself. The contemporary definition of cinema is the art of simulating experiences to communicate ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty or atmosphere by the means of recorded or programmed moving images along with other sensory stimulations.[1]

The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. Films were originally recorded onto plastic film which was shown through a movie projector onto a large screen (in other words, an analog recording process). The adoption of CGI-based special effects led to the use of digital intermediates. Most contemporary films are now fully digital through the entire process of production, distribution, and exhibition from start to finish. Films recorded in analog form traditionally included an optical soundtrack, which is a graphic recording of the spoken words, music and other sounds that are to accompany the images. It runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it and is not projected.

Films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures. They reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them. Film is considered to be an important art form, a source of popular entertainment, and a powerful medium for educating—or indoctrinating—citizens. The visual basis of film gives it a universal power of communication. Some films have become popular worldwide attractions by using dubbing or subtitles to translate the dialog into the language of the viewer. Some have criticized the film industry's glorification of violence[2] and its sexist treatment of women.[3][4]

The individual images that make up a film are called frames. During projection of traditional films, a rotating shutter causes intervals of darkness as each frame in turn is moved into position to be projected, but the viewer does not notice the interruptions because of an effect known as persistence of vision, whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after the source has been removed. The perception of motion is due to a psychological effect called phi phenomenon.

The name "film" originates from the fact that photographic film (also called film stock) has historically been the medium for recording and displaying motion pictures. Many other terms exist for an individual motion picture, including picture, picture show, moving picture, photoplay and flick. The most common term in the United States is movie, while in Europe film is preferred. Terms for the field in general include the big screen, the silver screen, the movies and cinema; the latter is commonly used in scholarly texts and critical essays, especially by European writers. In early years, the word sheet was sometimes used instead of screen.

<h3>CAST AND CREW</h3>
<dt><h4>Paul Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant-Man:</h4></dt>
<dd>A former systems engineer at VistaCorp and petty criminal, who acquires a suit that allows him to shrink in size but increase in strength.[4][5][6][7][8] Regarding Rudd's casting, producer Kevin Feige said, "Look at that origin of the petty crook who comes into contact with a suit and does his best to make good, and then look at someone like Paul Rudd, who can do slightly unsavory things like break into people’s houses and still be charming and who you root for and whose redemption you will find satisfaction in."[5] On the character, Peyton Reed said, "He's not used to being a hero. He's more like George Clooney['s character Danny Ocean] in Ocean's Eleven. He’s a guy trying to create a new life for himself and find redemption." To get in shape for the role, Rudd worked with trainers and cut alcohol, fried foods and carbohydrates out of his diet.[9] Rudd stated that in preparation for his role, he "basically didn’t eat anything for about a year ... I took the Chris Pratt approach to training for an action movie. Eliminate anything fun for a year and then you can play a hero."[10] Rudd signed a multi-film contract with Marvel, with Feige saying it was "three[ films]-plus-plus to appear in other things."[2]
</dd>
<br/>
<dt><h4>Evangeline Lilly as Hope van Dyne</h4></dt>
<dd>
The daughter of Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne and a senior board member of Pym Technologies, who helps Darren Cross take over the company.[11][12][13][14][15] Describing her character, Lilly said, "I was raised by two superheroes. So, I'm a pretty screwed up human being. I am also fairly capable, strong, and kick-ass, which is wonderful to play, but the most fun to play was just how messed up she was from being raised by two superheroes. And the clear message sent by my name is that I'm not a big fan of my father and so I took my mother's name."[16] She added that van Dyne's "arc in the movie is trying to find a relationship" with Pym.[9] Originally cast by Wright, Lilly was reluctant to take the role after he left the project until she read the revised script and got a chance to meet with Reed.[13] Feige said that van Dyne was the more obvious choice to take up the mantle of Ant-Man, being "infinitely more capable of actually being a superhero" than Lang, and that the reason she does not is because of Pym's experience with losing her mother, rather than sexism, which Feige felt would not be a problem for Pym in modern times. Subsequently, Feige stated that the film would hint at van Dyne eventually taking up the identity of Wasp from her mother.[17] Lilly signed a multi-film contract with Marvel.[18]
</dd>
<br/>
<dt><B>Corey Stoll as Darren Cross</B></dt>
<dd>A former protégé of Pym, who takes over Pym's company, and militarizes a similar version of the Ant-Man technology to create the Yellowjacket suit.[12][14][19][20] Describing the suit, Stoll said, "Darren Cross... has a suit that is sort of the next generation of Ant-Man’s suit. It can do everything that Ant-Man can do, but more. It’s more badass, more militaristic, sleeker... sort of like if Apple had designed a battle suit."[21] As for his character, Stoll said, "He is not a villain in the vein of Thanos or Loki, who are villains that know it. [Cross] is a guy who is not that dissimilar from Michael Douglas' character, Hank Pym. A brilliant scientist, who is not ethically pure. I think a great thing about the whole movie is that everybody in this movie is in those shades of gray a little bit."[22] Unlike Rudd, who wore a practical costume as Ant-Man, Stoll wore a motion capture suit when performing as Yellowjacket. Reed explained that this decision was made early on when creating and filming with a real Yellowjacket costume was found to be impractical.[23]
</dd>
<br/>
<dt><h4>Bobby Cannavale as Paxton</h4></dt>
<dd>
<I>A police officer[15][24][25] who is engaged to Lang's former wife Maggie.[26] Cannavale stated that Rudd and McKay convinced him to join the film, saying, "They sort of pumped [my] part up a bit in [their rewrite] and they both called me and said, 'You've got to do this.' They called me before Marvel called. I really went on good faith because they're so secretive over there about the script. I just trusted them." He also added that the process felt like an indie film instead of a large-scale blockbuster, and that he was able to improvise frequently along with the other actors.[26] Patrick Wilson was originally cast in the role[27] before leaving the film because of scheduling conflicts brought on by the filming delay.[28]</I>

<p style="color:red">
According to the Jain literature, Bharat and bali were two of the sons of Bhagwaan Rishabh Dev, the first TEERTHANKAR of this epoch. When Bhagwaan Rishabh Dev renounced his kingdom, he gave a portion of it to each one of his sons. Bharat and Bahubali also received their shares.
A few years later, Bharat decided to become the supreme ruler of the world (CHAKRAVARTI). He demanded that all other kings should accept his supremacy. All the kings, including his brothers except Bahubali conceded. However, Bahubali challenged Bharat. The armies of Bharat and Bahubali faced each other, ready to fight. The ministers of Bharat and Bahubali were worried about the bloodshed. Therefore, they counseled that the two brothers should engage in hand-to-hand combat to determine the winner. Bahubali and Bharat agreed.

The first round was a water-duel between Bharat and bali. They stood in the knee-deep water of a river and sprayed each other with water. bali won the round. The next round was a sight-duel. The two brothers stood in the sun, staring at each other. The one who blinked first was to lose the round. Again, Bharat lost. The final round was wrestling. A huge crowd had gathered. The supporters of each were cheering. In the course of the duel, Bahubali picked up Bharat. Carrying Bharat above his head, he whirled him in air as he paced the ring. bali's supporters were very happy and excited. bali was close to becoming the supreme ruler of the world. At that moment, he thought that he was about to hurt and humiliate his own brother for the sake of name and fame. He contemplated, "Such pride is false. What good is being a king or a supreme ruler of the world? Such desires are endless. Fulfillment of such desires cannot lead to peace of mind." He gently put Bharat down on his feet. He renounced his kingdom, and, started on the path to true happiness and peace of mind.

bali spent many years in meditation and penance. According to legend, he stood meditating for such a long time that anthills formed on the ground where he stood, snakes lay coiled at is feet, and creepers grew around them. But he did not attain omniscience (KEVAL JNAAN) because he had one straining conceit (SHALYA) in his mind. He was thinking that he was standing on the ground owned by his brother Bharat. For this reason, he could not shed the knowledge-obscuring, perception-obscuring, deluding and obstructing karmas that influence the soul. When Bharat came and consoled him, his mental strain vanished and he attained omniscience and NIRVANA.

Bhagwaan bali was a great soul and his story enlightens our lives. Chamundrai, the prime minister of King Rachmalla II of Ganga dynasty, built a colossal statue of Bhagwaan bali. It was consecrated under the guidance of the great Acharya Nemi Chandra Siddhant Chakravarti in 981 A.D. Chamundrai was also called Gommat and therefore the statue is called Gommateshwar. Chamundrai was a staunch follower of Acharya Nemi Chandra Siddhant Chakravarti. The two scriptural texts composed by Acharya Nemi Chandra Siddhant Chakravarti are entitled 'GOMMATASAAR JEEVAKAND' and 'GOMMATASAAR KARMAKAND'. www.gmail.com

The colossal statue of Gommateshwar stands 58 ft 8 in on the hill Vindhyagiri at Shravanabelgola near Mysore. It is the tallest known monolithic statue in the world carved out of a single huge granite boulder. In fact, the statue is part of the hill, sculpted by removing portions of the hilltop. The statue includes creepers, coiled snakes and anthills. The celebrated scholar, Kaka Kalelkar, describing the fact that it is nude, observed that the sculptors could easily extend the creepers to cover the nudity, but it would not have done justice to what Bhagwaan bali represented. Every twelve to fourteen years, the Great Head Bathing Ceremony (MAHA MASTAKAABHISHEK) of the statue is celebrated. The 1000th anniversary of the statue was observed between February 19 and 24, 1981, and the Great Head Bathing Ceremony was performed. In the March 16, 1981 issue of the TIME Magazine, the correspondent rightly observed, "The Great Head Bathing brings no absolution from sin. It propitiates no gods. ... Most important it does not help remove the oppressive cumulative weight of individual misdeeds known ... [as] KARMA. ... While the Hindus offered ritual, meditation and devotion to gods, the other two religions (Jainism and Buddhism) taught that KARMA and reincarnation could be escaped through the willed elimination of ego and desire."

In 1893, Thomas Edison built the first movie studio in the United States when he constructed the Black Maria, a tarpaper-covered structure near his laboratories in West Orange, New Jersey, and asked circus, vaudeville, and dramatic actors to perform for the camera. He distributed these movies at vaudeville theaters, penny arcades, wax museums, and fairgrounds. The pioneering Thanhouser film studio was founded in New Rochelle, New York in 1909 by American theatrical impresario Edwin Thanhouser. The company produced and released 1,086 films between 1910 and 1917, successfully distributing them around the world. The first film serial ever, Million Dollar Mystery, was released by the Thanhouser company in 1914.
In the early 1900s, companies started moving to Los Angeles, California. Although electric lights were by then widely available, none were yet powerful enough to adequately expose film; the best source of illumination for motion picture production was natural sunlight. Some movies were shot on the roofs of buildings in Downtown Los Angeles. Early movie producers also relocated to Southern California to escape Edison's Motion Picture Patents Company, which controlled almost all the patents relevant to movie production at the time.
The first movie studio in the Hollywood area was Nestor Studios, opened in 1911 by Al Christie for David Horsley. In the same year, another 15 independents settled in Hollywood. Other production companies eventually settled in the Los Angeles area in places such as Culver City, Burbank, and what would soon become known as Studio City in the San Fernando Valley.
